# Machine Learning Engineer | Researcher
I love building engineering projects from scratch. I'm both people and technology oriented, I have a good sense of both the technical and the broader product prespectives. I have experience in managing software products, data analysis, predictive modeling,  A/B testing and deployment of machine learning models to production.  

## Skills and Tools
- **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Bayesian Modeling, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning (Deep & Cross, DeepFFM), LLMs and RAG (llama-index).
- **Engineering:** Python (Flask & NGiNX, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, tensorflow), Java (SpringBoot), R.
- **Data Engineering:** SQL, Hive, BigQuery, Presto, Vertica, Redash.
- **Cloud and Infrastructure:** AWS (SageMaker, S3, EC2), Docker.
- **Additional Tools:** Git, Prometheus, Grafana, Arduino, Jupyter Notebooks.
- **Familiar With:** Fine-tuning LLMs, Spark-Scala, Kubernetes, pySpark.
