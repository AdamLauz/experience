# Machine Learning Engineer | Researcher
I love building engineering projects from scratch. I have a good sense of both the technical and the broader product prespectives. I have experience in managing software products, data analysis, predictive modeling,  A/B testing and deployment of machine learning models to production.  

## Skills and Tools
- **Machine Learning:** XGBoost, Bayesian Modeling, Logistic Regression, Deep Learning (Deep & Cross, DeepFFM), LLMs and RAG (llama-index).
- **Engineering:** Python (Flask & NGiNX, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy), Java (SpringBoot), R.
- **Data Engineering:** SQL, Hive, BigQuery, Presto, Vertica, Redash, MongoDB.
- **Cloud and Infrastructure:** AWS (SageMaker, RDS, S3, EC2, ECS tasks, ECR, EventBridge), Docker, Infrastructure-as-code (AWS-CDK).
- **Additional Tools:** Git, Prometheus, Grafana, Arduino, Jupyter Notebooks, mlflow.
- **Familiar With:** Fine-tuning LLMs, Spark-Scala, Kubernetes, pySpark.
- **Music Tech:** MIDI Programming (Python & music21, Arduino).
- **Music:** Jazz Harmony and arrangement, DAWs (Cubase, Ableton Live).
