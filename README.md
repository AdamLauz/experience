# AI Engineer
I am passionate about building solutions from the ground up and simplifying complex systems to make them more accessible. With a strong understanding of both technical details and the broader product vision, I excel at bridging the gap between development and real-world application.
My expertise lies in software project management, and in developing and deploying production-ready machine learning models. I have experience in fraud detection, ad recommendation systems, and personalized AI solutions. In my spare time, I enjoy building engineering projects.
